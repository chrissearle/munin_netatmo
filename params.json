So you might get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'NAApiErrorType' with message 'User usage reached' in /srv/git/netatmo/Netatmo-API/NAApiClient.php:356\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are using a cache file now, which stores the API results for 15 Minutes, so you shouldn't run in this problem anymore. If you have many Sensors you might have to increase the Cache-Timeout.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
